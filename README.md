## Summary
This repository contains all lab materials for the University of Washington course **Data Science for Biologists** (Winter 2019, [BIOL 419/519](https://www.washington.edu/students/crscat/biology.html)). Please feel free to use for any purpose.

Course design and lecture material (not included here) by [Bingni Brunton](https://github.com/bwbrunton) and [Kameron Harris](https://github.com/kharris/). Lab materials by Eleanor Lutz, with helpful suggestions from Bing and Kam.

This 2019 course used default package versions downloaded with `Anaconda 5.3.0`: `Pandas 0.23.4`, `Matplotlib 3.0.2`, `Numpy 1.15.4`, and `Scikit-Learn 0.20.2`.

## Student feedback
Students were asked to provide anonymous feedback to improve these labs. All substantial comments referencing labs (longer than a couple of words) are included below. If you improve these labs to address the suggestions please make a new branch or pull request! Student comments unrelated to lab content are redacted as [...].

### Student suggestions for improving labs
> Sometimes the labs were a little too long- could not feasibly finish in the allotted time.

> It would be nice if there are some brief introduction at the beginning of the lab section for some intro on what that day's lab will be about.

> [...] I wish [...] she took us through a harder problem for lab. [...]

> Maybe shorten I few of the lab exercises a bit.

> [...] It stretched my thinking because I wasn't sure what I was doing anyways. They expected a lot from you and wanted you to finish, lab was not long enough to finish literally ever or you had to start before to finish during section.

> Make lab a little longer, or make the actual assignment shorter. Keep the content the same, it was perfect! I refer back to lab all the time.

### Student opinions of most helpful aspects of lab content
> I appreciated that in the lab an example was given, and then we had the opportunity to practice on our own using that sample. [...]

> I really liked that we were able to work at our own pace in the lab and ask questions if needed. Step by step labs were very useful.

> [...] The format of the lab content files are also pretty straightforward and easy to understand.

> The labs often were very helpful [...]. The keys were very helpful references [...]. The labs were also well-timed, I usually was able to complete the lab before the end of class and sometimes had time for the bonus questions.

> [...] They were challenging and I learned a lot, but they were reasonable and help was always available.

> [...] The labs materials are very interesting yet challenging but it's good.

> The explanations on the script was very good and useful.

> Lab really helped me understand what I learned [...]. Lab keys were also extremely helpful [...]

> The labs were great, they really guided my learning [...]

> I think the labs were very helpful in understanding the material [...]

> The lab assignments were invaluable as they really helped me understand what we were doing [...]

> Yes, the lab class contributed well and introduced hands-on topics [...]

## Lab content
These labs were designed for students with no prior programming experience. Many sections of the code are intentionally written inefficiently, because students had not yet learned more advanced concepts (for loops, libraries, etc). A brief description of skills and topics covered in each lab is included below. Each lab is provided as a Jupyter Notebook both with and without answers, in addition to as `PDF` files (in the folders `PDF_Lab_Keys` and `PDF_Labs`).

### Lab 1
- Python data types
- Conditional logic in Python
- Looping over data in Python
- Introduction to libraries

### Lab 2
- Numpy arrays
- Importing data from a file into a Numpy array
- Examining and plotting data in a Numpy array

### Lab 3
- Matrix algebra by hand (10-minute class exercise, not included)
- Matrix algebra in Python
- Functions

### Lab 4
- Reading in data using the Pandas library
- Review of linear regression
- Plotting in three dimensions

### Lab 5
- Inspecting and cleaning data in Pandas
- Working with figure objects in Matplotlib
- Joining two Pandas dataframes
- Plots with multiple subplots
- Plotting scatterpoints colored by group

### Lab 6
- Review of importing and inspecting data
- Split a dataset into a training and test set
- Train a machine learning classifier using scikit-learn

### Lab 7
- K-means clustering using scikit-learn
- Custom Matplotlib legends
